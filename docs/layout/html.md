# BAS Style Kit Jekyll Theme

## HTML layout

A generic layout which defines a very basic HTML5 structure, with content placed in an empty `<body>` element using the
[`body`](/docs/include/body.md) include. An empty `<head>` element is set using the [`head`](/docs/include/head.md) 
include.

These includes are intended to be overridden to include necessary styles, scripts and page structure to suit the needs 
of individual sites - to use another style framework for example, or create a printer orientated design.

**Note:** This layout does not include information about the use of cookies, or other legal polices. This information
**MUST** be made available if the page content is used as a website.
