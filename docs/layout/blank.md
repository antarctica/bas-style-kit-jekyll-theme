# BAS Style Kit Jekyll Theme

## Blank layout

A generic layout which simply returns page content without any other page elements or structure. 

This layout is useful if you need to output content in a format other than HTML (such as JSON or XML).

**Note:** This layout does not include information about the use of cookies, or other legal polices. This information
**MUST** be made available if the page content is used as a website.

**Note:** You will need to set a suitable content-type header if returning non-HTML content.
