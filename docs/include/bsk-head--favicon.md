# BAS Style Kit Jekyll Theme

## BAS Style Kit Head favicon properties include

Defines optional, but recommended, HTML page properties to reference website icons - specifically:

* sets a favicon - if the
  [`bas_style_kit_jekyll_theme.attributes.head_favicon`](/docs/config/attributes.md) configuration option is set

This include is not designed to be overridden but **MAY** be omitted, however this can effectively by achieved if the
referenced configuration option is set to a null value.
