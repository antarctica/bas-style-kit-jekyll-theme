# BAS Style Kit Jekyll Theme

## BAS Style Kit Page header include

This include renders the `page.header` page variable as a HTML heading element wrapped in a header element.

It is designed to be overridden if a different content design is required.

**Note:** This include does not control where in the structure of a page the page title is shown.
