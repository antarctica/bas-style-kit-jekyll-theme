# BAS Style Kit Jekyll Theme

## Table of Contents (TOC) include

Implements the third-party [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc) include.

This is used over Karmadown's in-built TOC support where the TOC is not part of the page output, but part of a generic
layout.

There are [various parameters](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc#parameters) which can be used with this plugin. 
They can be set whenever this include is used.

This include is not designed to be overridden.
